尊敬的苹果审核组,你们好

今日早上我们注意到,我们的账号中收到的被标记删除的邮件,对此我们表示应该是一个误会.
因此,我们开发组于今日上午,联合运营部门召开了APP内容调查会议,主要调查APP中可能涉及违反开发者协议的地方.
经过一天的代码审查以及AppStore调查,总结出此次误会,原因应该为,我们的APP取名为”钱站”,误打误撞地与AppStore中的某个应用重名,但是我们承诺当初为APP取名的意图是由运营部门原创出的,并没有想到会与其他APP重名.
对此,我们修改了APP名字,为此还停止了市场部门以”钱站”为名的推广工作,等待APP改名通过后,再恢复推广工作.
最后声明,APP名字修改后为”融泽财富-江南银联”,”江南银联”为我司银联运营模块名称,”融泽财富”为APP名称,用以推广工作.
因此我们提起申诉,针对此次误会,希望审核组撤销该项决定.

非常感谢

Accurate Respected Apple Audit Team, Hello

We noticed this morning that the email we received in our account was marked and deleted, which we said should be a misunderstanding.

Therefore, our development team held an APP content survey meeting this morning by the Joint Operations Department to investigate possible violations of developer agreements in APP.

After a day's code review and the AppStore investigation, we concluded the misunderstanding. The reason should be that our app was named “钱站” and mistakenly renamed one of the apps in the AppStore. But we promised that the original intention of naming APP was originally created by the operation Department and did not expect to rename it with other apps.

To this end, we have revised the name of APP. To this end, we have stopped the marketing department's promotion work under the name of “钱站” and waited for the adoption of the name change of APP before resuming the promotion work.

Finally, it is stated that the name of APP has been changed to “融泽财富-江南银联”, “江南银联” is the name of our UnionPay operation module and “融泽财富” is the name of APP to promote the work.

Therefore, we appeal against this misunderstanding and hope that the audit team will revoke the decision.

Thank you very much.
